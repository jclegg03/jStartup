## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following:

- [x] **HTML pages** - I have 4 complete pages for my webpage to login, track goals, add friends, and see achievements.
- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used various HTML elements to represent what I was trying to display on the page. This includes text, images, links, headers, and footers.
- [x] **Links** - I have links to each of my pages in the header of each page. I also have a link to my github in the footer of each page.
- [x] **Text** - Text is used as a placeholder for many future features of my page.

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following:

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Navigation and flex displays.
- [x] **Navigation elements** - These are displayed at the top of the page.
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - I remove the navigation and footer when the screen height is too small. I also remove some side padding when there isn't enough width.
- [x] **Application elements** - I styled each of my elements and used bootstrap for buttons and text boxes.
- [x] **Application text content** - I aligned my text using CSS
- [x] **Application images** - I used CSS to set my image's size.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - I set it up as an NPM package. I then installed vite to use during development.
- [x] **Components** - The pages are now each their own jsx file with the header and footer being its own jsx file.
- [x] **Router** - The app now uses a React router to navigate between the pages. Now this is pod racing.

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - I made a lot more components. My pride and joy is the timer and streak functionality I made in the time.js file.
- [x] **Hooks** - React `useState` is used for variables that will be displayed. `useEffect` is used to force the page to render certain items correctly on reload/open. This is because some items aren't formatted correctly before being passed to the component that needs them.
