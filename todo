FIX:
- Some quotes may still show up with the &#8230; form.
- confirm a friend request is being sent only to real users.
- make sure you aren't adding yourself as friend.
- make sure friend request isn't a duplicate of existing friend request.
- change friend object structure to say user1, user2 for better readability.

FORMAT:
- super long goals cause the remove friend button to go to the right of the friend box.
- delete button on the goal screen can also be placed to high due to this.

TODO:
- make enter key submit new goals and friends
- clear out goal and friend field upon submitting.
- make default error handler notify user of error
