IMPORTANT:
- fix goal duplicating upon updating streak? happended once but havent seen it again yet. May be result of the quick refresh when testing
- limit spam clicking to prevent websocket overload. (website will stop making database entries and refreshing them but websocket keeps sending messages just fine)

FIX:
- Some quotes may still show up with the &#8230; form.
- confirm a friend request is being sent only to real users.
- make sure you aren't adding yourself as friend.
- make sure friend request isn't a duplicate of existing friend request/friend.
- change friend object structure to say user1, user2 for better readability.
- set limit on number of goals

EFFICIENCY:
- fix how goals are updated in time.js (it kinda slow)

FORMAT:
- super long goals cause the remove friend button to go to the right of the friend box.
- delete button on the goal screen can also be placed to high due to this.

TODO:
- make enter key submit new goals and friends
- clear out goal and friend field upon submitting.
- make default error handler notify user of error
